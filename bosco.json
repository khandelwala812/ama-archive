I found an interest in programming at a reasonably young age and continuously learned.  My learning was multiplied when I started asking more questions from people way better than me in various online communities.  There's a lot of theory that goes into Software Engineering but at the end of the day reading and writing code, then learning is the best way in my opinion to improve.  So don't focus on what resource teach you the best, focus on surrounding yourself with people better than you and be open to learning!",

I think one of the biggest myths surrounding big companies is \"If Facebook / Google / ... does X then we should too.\" -> That's not even close to true.  A lot of times the reason these companies do things is because they tried to do the normal way and it literally didn't work at their org size, scale, etc.  I see this pretty often and it's probably been the reason behind a lot of bad decisions in smaller companies.\n\nIf I think of a myth about actually working in the company I will edit this, but I couldn't think of anything.  I think it's a great question though!",

You're basically saying X or bust, and it puts a ton of pressure on yourself.  Now, if you're trying to learn, and grow yourself as an engineer I would say what I said in a previous answer - continuously learn and improve.  If you can look back 6 months ( maybe even 3 honestly ) and feel like you haven't improved you need to reassess what you're doing.  The field moves fast, and if you're regularly practicing, improving, and learning you should see pretty steady results.  \n\nIf you're already looking at these companies and you're about to start reaching out at the new grad level, pretty much leetcode is the answer.  Strive to be more than a leetcode engineer though \uD83D\uDE09",

There is the scale challenge, but assuming something like Jenkins could still work at this level of deployment ( and I have no idea if it could ) we also integrate throughout all the other infrastructure non-custom tools would either not know about, or have to write and maintain a ton of plugins to teach it.  Things like our code review tool, pushing through our container management system ( think kubernetes ) using our custom source control with our custom file system and all these pieces it just becomes a way to optimize for getting the most value out of all of our tools.",

      "content": "**Bosco:** I guess it would depend on the language, erlang I basically grep around for similar examples and copy paste.  I barely write code in this, but sometimes have to.  I pretty much have no clue what's going on.  Lol.  Everything else I am more or less comfortable enough.  With C++ I make sure to get a really solid review because I'm basically forced to keep track of what Rust would do for me, and if there's one thing my brain is not, it's a borrow checker.  I would say we have a great internal community about helping people learn our tools, languages, and all that so you're probably always going to be able to get help with your stuff",

But I think one thing I do pretty well is ride the line of building things to be extensible in the future without getting swept up by YAGNI.  Meaning I toe the line of over-engineering so in a month you can do all this crazy flexible stuff and whatever you want is already supported versus writing it with one exact use-case in mind end-to-end and a new idea or feature needs a rewrite ( these are obviously two extremes ).  I've always felt pretty comfortable and proud of my ability to toe that line and be able to move reasonably quick while leaving the door open for the future improvements!",

You learn what some people are working on and you're like \"oh cool didn't know we did that\" or something, but at the small company I knew every tool, every line of code, every service, etc.  You kinda have to accept that you don't know a large amount of what's going on when you're at a bigger place",

When I first started with the language we would do a couple meetings a week ramping me up on the language and teaching me.  I was also appreciative that they brought many things into Java terms as that was my most comfortable language.  Overall, it took about 4 weeks of complete fighting with the borrow checker to feel like I was able to make progress.  By week 6 I felt like I was able to do my work without too much hassle.  I'm still learning, but it's rare that I'm just sitting there completely stumped on it now, and if I am I can always ask for help!",

For a random benefit you may not see elsewhere, you can get your oil changed, gas filled up, and tires rotated ( plus a few other things ) on campus you just drop your car off.  Also they will do laundry for you as well!",

I would recommend taking a look and seeing if it interests you because I definitely have enjoyed it!",

I definitely think it's well on its way to gaining more adoption as these big companies start to financially back it.  I would love to see more rust opportunities all over as I think it's a great language.  I don't think you have to care about performance to get benefit out of Rust, but it's nice that if you do care about performance you're already in a language that can support you.  We use it for CRUD services, CLI tools, rpc services, etc.  It's great all around and general purpose!",

At the start-up, there was less work to do, but everything was on fire, everything was high priority ( which really means nothing was ) and the amount of context switching made you inefficient, but this \"has to get done now\".  So ultimately I felt more overworked at the start-up because of that.",

No one is going to be a 10x engineer when they literally hate logging on every morning and working on their project.\n\nThe thing I would set-up early is every team protects their internal data, structures, and otherwise with public APIs other teams must go through to access them as I think historically that has been a pain point on my team.",

      "content": "**Bosco:** For some people I think so yes.  I've seen some people excel during remote and others plummet.  I think the thing to be careful is allowing a hybrid team could negatively impact those that enjoy in-office.  Say you have a team of 8 that is close-knit and you say \"choose which style of work that affects you the best\" and 4 of those teammates go remote.  That isn't only affecting them, but the other teammates who get fulfilled and happier in a close-knit in person team.  I think it's tricky to quantify, but I think in a team that is able and willing to support remote work and an engineer who enjoys remote work can definitely be just as successful or more than they might be in-office.  There's just plenty of variables to look for.",

If a team isn't cooperating your manager is essentially your bat, but luckily everyone has been great to work with for me.  It's up to the teams how they would like to manage, we don't do anything even close to scrum and I have no idea what process name I would give to us.  We just kinda work on what we feel is important and deliver things that bring us closer to our goals.  It's abstract, and it feels like that in practice as well.",

Overall I do feel for people who are affected very heavily by imposter syndrome.  I would offer advice, but I really don't have any other than mental care is just as important as physical care so check out options like therapy if it makes sense for you!",

One thing to think about is when FB was hitting these scale problems the gold standards may quite literally not have existed.  Like people find it weird we have our own system that's similar to Kubernetes but our version was being used in production before k8s even released.  So sometimes it's timing.  I think we are definitely good about using open source stuff where possible and trying to only rewrite it if we have concerns.  Also at least in my time since I've been here I've submitted fixes, and improvements upstream to open source libraries which is really neat to be able to help out and then everyone wins!",
